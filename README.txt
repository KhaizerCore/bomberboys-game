# TO RUN THE PROJECT 
1 - Crate an SQL database using the commands from the file database-config.sql
3 - Go to the file "client.py", more precisely at the line 10 and change the value of the IP address to your local IP. (You can check your IP by opening the CMD - Windows - and typing "ipconfig" and checking the IPv4 address).
2 - When the database is all set up and running, run the newtork.py file. This will be our server.
3 - When the server prompt shows that it is "waiting for a connection", you can open another terminal and run "main.py" file.
4 - Now you're ready to play! =).

This project was created as a college project of the subject "Distributed Systems" and It's a 2D live game based on multiple players. 
The intention of this game is to recreate the experience of bomberman game.


This project was developed without the usage of Git, but i felt that i needed to create a repo of it.
At the time i did not have much experience with network communications, so things were thought on the go, no clean code, TDD and etc applied.

I hope that i can show off as well some of my skills, on this case with Python. But the most important,  network communication and synchronization.
