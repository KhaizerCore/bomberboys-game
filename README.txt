This project was created as a college project of the subject "Distributed Systems" and It's a 2D live game based on multiple players. 
The intention of this game is to recreate the experience of bomberman game.

This project was developed without the usage of Git, but i felt that i needed to create a repo of it.
At the time i did not have much experience with network communications, so things were thought on the go, no clean code, TDD and etc applied.

I hope that i can show off as well some of my skills, on this case with Python. But the most important,  network communication and synchronization.
